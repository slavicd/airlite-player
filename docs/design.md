# Airlite Design Brief

## Problem

In Romania of late 2019 there is no resource that an average person can access 
in order to assess with ease the current and historical state of affairs 
concerning air quality in his city or across the whole country.

The existing infrastructure consists of a few independent, volunteer-based 
networks of air-quality stations that mostly measure pollutants such as 
particulate matter, and a state-run network of stations that doesn't do a 
very good job at disseminating its findings.

Although data that would allow for substantial analysis and assessment is 
generally available, the process that one has to go through in order to 
synthesize a conclusion for a given region is not for the average person.

## Audience

Adult and teenage population in Romania that are preoccupied about the 
quality of ambient air. Eventually people outside Romania.

## Constraints

#### Data validity

The nature of aggregated data from volunteer networks, which is the main
way the proposed solution shall aquire data, is prone to errors. Factors 
influencing such mismeasurements include
faulty sensors, bad station design, improper installation and exploitation 
of the station among other things.

#### Understading of the subject by the general population

In order to objectively inform the population about the quality of air
the population needs to understand what the unit of measure for "air quality"
is. See [units choice](./units-choice.md) document for an overview of 
reporting units. 

## Deliverables

A responsive (optimized for mobile devices) web application that would allow 
for an easy and comprehensive assessment of air quality based on available 
data from existing volunteer and state-run stations.
